The code in this repository is provided under a 2-clause BSD license,
as given at the end of this file, unless otherwise noted in each file.

NetBSD source code is required for successful execution.  NetBSD is
licensed under a BSD style license, but third party code imported into
the NetBSD tree's "external" section may have a differing license.  For
example, source code licensed under CDDL is found in src/external/cddl.
Almost all of the produced rump kernel components fall under a BSD
license, but when pertinent, verify the license of a component by
examining its source code.
